<p>Dale Steyn has now played in 71 test matches picking up 361 wickets at
an average of 22.89. This is indeed a great achievement. It has also
happened in an era when most bowlers average around 30. But how awesome
is Dale Steyn? Has he always been this awesome? Does anyone else come
near? Does his awesomeness have to do with where he plays most of his
cricket? In search for these answers I took to Cricinfo Statsguru. From
there, I downloaded Match Totals (Overs/Maidens/Runs/Wickets) by Bowler
for every test match (Ground / Opposition and Start Date uniquely
identified test match) between Dec 17 2004 (Dale Steyn’s Debut) – Feb 20
2014 (Steyn’s last game). To exclude rare part-timers whose figures
provide no value in predicting Bowler success, I used a rather arbitrary
criterion of Bowlers with more than 20 Overs per Match. This left me
with 245 bowlers of whom 167 were classified as Pace Bowlers.</p>
<p>First, I plotted the distribution of bowling averages by Year. There are
obviously some outliers (avg. &gt; 200) and 2004 and 2014 include only
about a month of data. Excluding these two years, the Median Bowling
Average (solid blue line) ranges from 29.6 (in 2013) to 34.9 (in 2006).
It depresses me to think that the median price of a wicket in test
cricket would be 35. On the bright side, Ishant Sharma would have had a
realistic chance of being below the 50^th^ percentile. The 25^th^ and
75^th^ percentiles (dashed blue lines) ranged from 22.7 (2013) -28
(2009) and 39.9 (2013) – 50.4 (2006) respectively. Dale Steyn has been
around the 25^th^ percentile (solid red line), having his best year in
2006 – 49 wickets at 16.53, and worst year in 2011 – 22 wickets at
29.86.</p>

<p>Among all bowlers in his era who played in 10 or more matches and picked
up 50 or more wickets, Steyn has the fourth-best average.</p>

<p>This is the story told by crude averages. But as noted earlier, there
are factors that play a role in determining bowling averages. Dare I say
that if Steyn played most of his cricket in India, he would have
different figures? What if we gave them our two Sharmas, R Ashwin and a
future left-arm spinner from the Ranji circuit to find out – fair trade?
No? But to find out, I employed some statistical methods. Firstly, I
used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_logit">regression model</a> to
predict how many wickets a bowler would pick up in a match using
Opposition (Bangladesh are a test team), Ground or Venue (Mitch at WACA
is like Murali in a Kandy store), Home or Away (ask R Ashwin), Balls
Bowled (more you bowl, more you get - unless you’re bowling to Faf on
day 5) and Bowler Type (Pace or Spin) as predictors (Model fit:
G^2^=13246, df=43285, p-value=0.999 = goood!). I also let the effects of
Grounds the match was played on to vary depending on the type of Bowler
which I think is a justifiable assumption.This model gave me the
probabilities of a bowler picking up anywhere between 0-13 wickets in
each match, using which I calculated the expected number of wickets. I
stopped estimating probabilities at 13 wickets as the largest tally of
wickets in this time period was <a href="http://bit.ly/1csB3qy">13 by M
Ntini</a>. Then, I fit another regression model to
predict the number of runs a bowler would concede in a match using the
same predictors (Model fit: R^2^=0.68 = good!).</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Now, using the predicted (or expected)
wickets and runs for each bowler in a match I arrived at expected
averages (=Predicted Runs / Predicted Wickets). So, for each bowler I
had an Observed (Crude) and an Expected (Predicted) average. I used the
ratio of Observed / Expected Averages as a measure of bowler
performance, with a smaller ratio indicating superior performance - just
like bowling averages. By this measure, Dale Steyn’s performance does
not stand out as much but still stands out. He comes in ninth among all
bowlers who played in 10 or more matches and picked up 50 or more
wickets and fourth among active players (minus Amir,</span><a href="http://bit.ly/1q3vd2l">bring back
Amir</a><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> ). A big
surprise here is Ryan Harris who by this measure appears to be highly
underrated. Philander has been phenomenal but I expect to see some
regression to the mean. In case you’re curious, Mitchell Johnson is
25</span>^th^<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> – only doing somewhat
better than he’s expected to (O/E Ratio of 0.91) and behind Zaheer Khan
and teammate Nathan Lyon. Here's the entire list

<p>However, no other bowler in his era seems to have enjoyed the consistent
success that Dale Steyn has. By the O/E measure Dale Steyn has been
around the 25^th^ percentile, doing worse than expected only once, in
’05 (O/E of 1.04), and managing fantastic returns in 2006. when everyone
else seemed to struggle, and 2013 (O/E of 0.65 and 0.61 respectively).</p>

<p>So, Steyn’s a beast but not perfect. I’m glad I didn’t spend two days
figuring out what I could have learnt from looking at his career info
page at Cricinfo. It should be interesting to see how Steyn’s career
achievements compare with that of former greats like Marshall, Mcgrath,
Lillee, Waqar and Wasim using the metric discussed here.</p>
