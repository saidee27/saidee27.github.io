</p>      <p>Recently, Nate Silver wrote about <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/drafting-sophomores-is-a-smart-strategy-for-nba-teams/">drafting sophomores being a ‘Smart’
strategy in the NBA
draft</a>.
As Silver points out, rookie scale contracts are valid for four years,
with team options for the third and fourth year i.e., a team can get rid
of draft picks after their second or third season, or have to decide on
offering them an extension around the start of the fourth year.
<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-is-winning-the-nba-draft-lottery-really-worth/">Rookie-scale contracts provide the most wins for
money</a>
and good teams (should) capitalize on this by making well-researched
picks. For lottery and early first round draft picks, while most of them
are likely to get really good by the fourth year, they also get really
expensive at that point. While, <a href="http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm">teams which draft the player can offer
him the maximum money</a>, it may not
be a bad idea to get a lot more cheap wins in the first four years given
that there's no guarantee that the player won't take his talents
elsewhere. Teams with mid-late first round picks should maybe look
to draft players who peak early in their careers and since these players
are not likely to have much upside, teams can afford (or maybe should)
not to offer them a max contract at the end of the fourth year. Apart
from getting you more wins for less money, players who peak early may
also be of help for late first round drafting teams, which are usually
contenders, in their quest for a title. Think Rondo, Leonard and not the
<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/milicda01.html">Human Victory
Cigar</a>.</p>
<p>What Nate Silver found was that sophomores produced more wins in the
first five years of their careers than any other group of players. I
decided to check this out myself. So, I went about gathering data (from
basketball-reference.com) on first round (top 30) draft picks from 1998
– 2013 and looked at <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html">Win
Shares</a> produced^1^.
As expected, for the first 5 years of their career sophomores had more
Win Shares than juniors, freshmen / high school, international players.
Although, freshmen and high schoolers seem to distance themselves from
the other groups after five years, sophomores and juniors seem to be
getting the better of them in the first four years with respect to
number of wins produced. While both sophomores and juniors seem to grow
faster than freshmen/HS in this period, sophomores also seem to start
higher - produce more wins in the first year then freshmen and juniors.</p>
<p>[=<img alt="Image" src="https://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/overall_gg.jpeg?w=660" /></p>
<p>For now, let’s concentrate on the first four years. Through the first
four years of their career sophomores produced 10.1 wins, which was 0.4
wins more than freshmen and high schoolers who produced 9.6 wins. You
can see this in the plot below. You’ll also notice that this is mainly
due to sophomore (and junior) Guards outperforming freshmen and high
school Guards through the first 4 years of their NBA career. Indeed,
freshmen/HS centers did much better than sophomore Centers and there was
not much of a difference when in came to Forwards.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/cfgall50.jpeg?w=660" /></p>
<p>It is worth noting here that I did not find out any of these differences
to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance">statistically significant at the .05
level</a> (i.e., if
it were true that the number of wins produced was the same for all
groups, there is more than a 5 % chance that we would have observed
differences at least as extreme as what we did observe). But, this
difference is not adjusted for Draft Pick position. My guess was that
since freshmen and high schoolers tend to go higher in the draft the
differences are biased toward the null i.e., I expected the differences
between sophomore and freshmen / HS Guards to be significant after
controlling for the Draft Pick position. Another factor I thought needed
to be adjusted for was the number of games played. The more you play the
more wins you produce. It is worth mentioning here that I looked at the
first four years after which the player was drafted regardless of when
they actually started playing. For example, Blake Griffin’s first season
was 2009-10.</p>
<p>So, after controlling for number of games played and Pick position, I
found that both sophomores and juniors produced 4.6 [95% <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cochran/stat10/winter/lectures/lect12.html">Confidence
Interval</a>:
1.6 – 7.6] wins more than freshmen and high schoolers through their
first 4 years. Surprisingly, I found that, controlling for the number of
games played, even seniors did significantly better than freshmen and
high schoolers picked at the same position in the draft producing an
additional 3.9 [95% CI: 1.0 – 6.9] wins through their first 4 years.
Further, most seniors (87% or 44/51) and juniors (75% or 35/47) were
drafted beyond the top 10, while exactly half of the freshmen/HS to play
in the NBA were drafted in the top 10. So, while from the figure above
it looks like freshmen/HS are at least producing more wins than seniors
in their first four years, given that they were mostly picked higher
they should be producing a lot more wins. This indicates that freshmen /
HS guards are perhaps overvalued, seniors undervalued and juniors and
sophomores seriously undervalued. It may also be that teams are not that
concerned about the production in the first 4 years. This might be a
mistake - because how do you know <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-to-sign-an-nba-player-to-the-max/">who’s worth a
max</a>?</p>
<p>For Forwards and Centers, as expected, the freshmen/HS group does not
seem to be significantly better than any of the other groups with
respect to wins produced after controlling for draft pick position.
While that means that there is no significant advantage in picking
freshmen or high school Forwards to be had in the short term (over the
first 4 years), it might just be the better strategy in the long term as
freshmen/HS players seem to have a better upside after the first four
years.</p>
<p>Now, for guards, I wanted to see if there was any difference in the
trajectory or the rate at which sophomores, juniors and freshmen
improved during their first four years. The figure below makes me think
that this might be the case.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="http://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/guards2.jpeg?w=660" /></p>
<p>So, I fit a linear model to predict a player’s win shares in each of his
first four years in the league and tested if the yearly change in wins
produced (rate of growth) was different for sophomores, freshmen/HS,
juniors, internationals and seniors^2^. As I did previously, I
controlled for the effect of the draft pick position and the number of
games played.  I also controlled for the effect of Win-Loss percent of
the team in which the player played that season^3,4^. Doing so, gave me
a good comparison of the rates of growth in each category and an
interesting pattern emerged. I found that the more years a player spent
in college the earlier he peaked or had a growth spurt. In the first
year seniors produced more wins than any other group. This translated to
1.03 [95% CI: 0.1 – 1.95] more wins produced than freshmen/HS guards
in the first year. Thereafter, from year 1 to year 2, Juniors had the
highest increase in Win shares, growing at +1.13 [95% CI: 0.36 – 1.92]
more wins than freshmen/HS. Finally, from year 1 to year 3 and year 1 to
year 4, Sophomores showed the largest growth in wins produced. From year
1 to year 4, sophomores grew at +1.3 [95% CI: 0.14 – 2.46] more wins
than freshmen/HS.</p>

<p>The relationship between NBA-readiness and the number of years spent in
college can be easily demonstrated by looking at the best players with
respect to first year production, second year growth and third year
growth. Outside of the top 10 whom we might expect to do very well in
the first year and where seniors are seldom picked, the best performance
in terms of Win Shares comes from Courtney Lee, a Senior picked 22nd in
the 2008, who produced 4.4 win shares. The next best player picked
beyond 10 was Tony Parker with 3.8 win shares. In terms of second year
growth, four of the top five players in this category were Juniors.
Here’s the top five:</p>
<ol>
<li>Baron Davis, <em>Sophomore</em>, drafted 3^rd^ in 1999: +6.8 win shares</li>
<li>Vince Carter, <em>Junior</em>, drafted 5^th^ in 1998: +6.8 win shares</li>
<li>Dwayne Wade, <em>Junior</em>, drafted 5^th^ in 2003: +6.7 win shares</li>
<li>Ronnie Brewer, <em>Junior</em>, drafted 14^th^ in 2006: +6.1 win shares</li>
<li>Steve Francis, <em>Junior</em>, drafted 2^nd^ in 1999: +5.8 win shares</li>
</ol>
<p>And when it comes to improvement from year 1 to year 3, four of the top
5 players are sophomores. The top five were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gilbert Arenas, <em>Sophomore</em>, drafted 30^th^ in 2001: +8.8 win shares</li>
<li>James Harden, <em>Sophomore</em>, drafted 3^rd^ in 2009: +8.3 win shares</li>
<li>Kevin Martin, <em>Junior</em>, drafted 26^th^ in 2004: +8.3 win shares</li>
<li>Chris Paul, <em>Sophomore</em>, drafted 4^th^ in 2005: +7.9 win shares</li>
<li>Rajon Rondo, <em>Sophomore</em>, drafted 21^st^ in 2006: +7.2 win shares</li>
</ol>
<p>So, it is fairly clear that the more time you spend in college the more
ready you are for the NBA. And depending on how early a team wants to
get the most out of its' pick in the first four years and how long it
intends to keep the player, the smartest strategy might be to pick
seniors, juniors or sophomores. What remains to be seen is if after year
four or five, freshmen/HS guards show a higher growth rate than all the
other groups and perhaps eventually reach a higher ceiling, which I
suspect they would, and if so what is the difference in terms of long
term wins produced. From the plot above, it seems like sophomores,
juniors and freshmen/HS are pretty much at the same level at year 10. If
this remains the case after adjusting for pick position, drafting
sophomore and junior guards might be the best thing to do. Of course,
international players are tough to predict and their growth, among other
things, might depend on the nature and amount of previous basketball
experience.</p>

<p>FOOTNOTES</p>
<ol>
<li>This included 117 seniors, 106 juniors, 86 sophomores, 90
    freshmen/HS (66 freshmen + 24 HS) and 69 international players.</li>
<li>Among guards there were 51 seniors, 51 juniors, 36 sophomores, 36
    freshmen/HS and 21 international players.</li>
<li>The model I used was:\
    Win Shares \~ Pk + Year in league +
    College experience (SR/JR/SO/FHS/INT.) + College experience*Year in
    league + Games played + Win% of team.</li>
<li>Yes, I adjusted for correlation between multiple observations from
    the same player by specifying an unstructured covariance structure.</li>
