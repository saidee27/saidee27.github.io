</small>
</p>      <p>What? Why?</p>
<p>In-game win-probability is not a very new thing; there are in-game
win-probability calculators/graphs
for <a href="http://live.advancednflstats.com/">NFL</a>, MLB
(somewhere) and <a href="http://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/wpCalc.php">Basketball</a>.
But surprisingly, there seems to be none for Cricket and I don't think
I've seen live broadcasts displaying win probabilities or another metric
that lets you objectively track the progress of the match (aside from
the score, which is not quite the same). Most often, I'm left with Ravi
Shastri's assessments of if a game is going down to the wire, which I
find lacking in information. And even for Shastri's bot-like features,
his assessments of who holds the upper hand in a game of cat and mouse,
when push comes to shove, are not very unbiased.</p>
<p>So, I took it upon myself to come up with an in-game win-probability
metric for T20 games. Mostly because I like seeing t<a href="http://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/b984e-sas_mia_gm6.png">hese kind of
graphs</a>
after the fact and think there might be a few others in this world. But
also because win probability can be used to calculate win probability
added which might be the most unambiguous metric for player evaluations
and comparisons.</p>
<p>For Whom?</p>
<p>So, in-game win-probability is something for the bookies right? I don't
know. Maybe, For everyone? I like knowing (rather than guessing) the
likelihood of my team winning when they score 240 but give away 40 in
the first two overs while picking up a wicket. I would like to know how
much ground they lost by conceding 40 in the first two overs and then
how much they regained by picking up a wicket. For example, let's look
at some interesting past IPL matches, using win-probability graphs.</p>
<p>1. KKR vs CSK - 2012 Final: Anatomy of a chase</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/kkrcsk2012.png?w=660" /></p>
<p>CSK won the toss, batted first and somewhat settled for a score of 190
 for the loss of only three wickets. At the break, they had a
probability of 0.7 (or a 70% chance) of winning the game. This increased
to slightly above 80% within the first 10 balls of Kolkata's innings
where notably Gambhir fell at the end of the first over scoring just two
runs. KKR was 3-1 at the end of the first over. Chennai or an average
team should have won from here 80% of the time. Thereafter, though,
Kallis and Bisla took the score to 139 in 14.4 overs (84 balls). They
had all but wrestled away CSK's advantage, as you can see, as by ball
200 of the game CSK's chances of winning had gone down to nearly 20%.
But things turned again and at the fall of Kalllis wicket (175-5 at 18.5
overs) Chennai's chances of winning the game had spiked up to nearly
45%. KKR finished strong though and in doing so completed a fine chase.
The last data point on the graph here is the ball before the deciding
ball, which was at 19.3 overs when KKR was 188/5.</p>
<p>2.  KKR vs RR - 04/29/2014 : Tie?</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/kkrrr14tie.png?w=660" /></p>
<p>Rajasthan won the toss and made a score that was somewhere above easy
and below challenging. The match was pretty much on an even keel and
there was not much separation with respect to win probabilities until
ball 202, when Gambhir followed Pandey (out on ball 198) after a
somewhat steady partnership to leave KKR at 88/4 with 65 to get off 38
balls. Rajasthan nearly had a 70% chance of winning it then. But a very
good partnership brought the score to 137/4 in 18 overs and RR's chances
reduced to something like 20%. That's when Faulkner bowled a magic over
reducing KKR to 141/7 at 19 overs which soon became 146/8 at 19.2 overs.
With, 3 runs required of the last ball and numbers 9 and 10 in, RR had
something around a 75% chance of getting away with it. KKR managed to
tie.</p>
<p>3. CSK vs MI - 05/06/2012: Dwayne Smith FTW!</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/cskmi2012.png?w=660" /></p>
<p>Chennai did about okay again with a target of 174. Mumbai were sitting
pretty at 134/1 at 15.4 overs, having cut CSK's chances to around 20%.
But even after Sachin fell and DK fell (147/3 at 17 overs) CSK could not
have been feeling very lucky (same 20% chance as before). But then, how
I don't know, the score became 160/8 at 19.3 overs, giving CSK a 95%
chance of  winning the game. But Dwayne Smith happened. The last point
plotted here is the penultimate ball of the game, wherein MI still
needed 4 to win with 2 wickets in hand. It is hard to argue with the
assessment that CSK had an 80% chance of winning it then.</p>
<p>4. RR vs Deccan - 04/24/2008: Hello IPL!</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/rrdc08.png?w=660" /></p>
<p>A score of 214 ought to win you 20 over games, or that's what the Deccan
Chargers of '08 thought. It's hard to argue too, they had a win
probability of slightly above 0.9 at the break. But this was 2008, and
Yusuf Pathan was concentrating on his hitting. After 9 overs (174 balls
in the game) RR had scored 110/1, with Pathan blasting 60 off 26. You
could see this point it was virtually a coin-toss. Soon after, RR lost
the plot a bit but regained tremendous ground between overs 14 and 16
where they scored 57 runs. At the start of over 17 they were 186/3
needing 29 off 18, which meant they had a probability of 0.7 (1 - 0.3)
at ball 222. This equation became 14 off 4 with only 3 wickets in hand,
which meant they had something like a 1-in-10 chance of doing it. They
did though finishing with four, six and six in the next three balls from
their captain Shane Warne.</p>
<p>There are 416 other games which you can find and browse through on:
<a href="https://saidee.shinyapps.io/winprobpast/">https://saidee.shinyapps.io/winprobpast/</a>. I think you might have fun.
If you do find something peculiar, do let me know. One thing to note is
that I do not have all matches on file (420 / 458) and I excluded
matches which involved Drs. Duckworth and Lewis.</p>
<p>Win Probability Calculator and How it Works?</p>
<p>Okay, so great there are some 400+ graphs to look at, so what? Well,
there is also this - <a href="https://saidee.shinyapps.io/winprot20/">https://saidee.shinyapps.io/winprot20/</a> .  It is
an in-game win-probability calculator for the second innings of Twenty20
games. Check it  out!  I was waiting just for the end of Champions'
Trophy to burst out this useless tool. Just kidding, I had no idea of
when the Champions Trohpy (is it the Champions League or Trophy?)
started or ends.</p>
<p>I use two separate locally weighted logistic regression models for the
first and second innings of a match to get win probabilities at any
point in-game. The model for the first innings assumes that at any given
time win probability is a function of total runs  scored by batting
team, total wickets and total balls bowled. The model for the second
innings assumes a similar relationship between win probability and balls
remaining, wickets lost by team batting second, runs remaining in
target. As you'd have figured by now I offset the win probability
calculations in the second innings by what it was in the final ball of
the first innings. I built these models using the 420 IPL games
previously mentioned in this post (training data). An important point to
make here is that these win probabilities are team-neutral /
player-neutral and ground (or conditions) - neutral. Or in other words
I'm not accounting for these factors in my model. So, the probabilities
reported by the model are the chances that the average team playing in
the average conditions will win given the current situation.</p>
<p>So, Check it out. Let me know what you think!</p>
