</p>      <p>Dale Steyn is <a href="http://saidee27.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/2/">pretty darn
good</a>. No doubt. But is his
place among the likes of McGrath and Marshall. Does he belong / does he
deserve a mention? I figure most of us would think he would belong. He
is in quite <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=1;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=bowling_strike_rate;qualmin1=300;qualval1=wickets;template=results;type=bowling">rarefied
company</a>
as one of only twenty-one pace bowlers to pick up 300 wickets in Test
Cricket. Furthermore, at a cost of 22.56 runs per wicket his wickets
have come cheaper than that of fourteen others on this list and at 41.7
balls per wicket have come fastest. That should pretty much settle it.
But for naysayers (same people who deny climate change?) who think Dale
Steyn is lucky to play in conditions good for fast bowling and for those
who lose sleep at night over whom to include in their fantasy Greatest
Ever World XI’s pace attack I did some statistical analysis to figure
out how special Steyn is and how the other legends of pace bowling
compare with each other. Among other things, it also helped me quantify
how bad Ajit Agarkar was, how bad Ishant Sharma is and find out who were
some of the other really bad pace bowlers to have played a decent amount
of Test cricket.</p>
<p>I retrieved, from Cricinfo Statsguru, match-level data for all pace
bowlers who bowled in Test Matches from 1 Jan 1971 till 31 Jul 2014.
While Cricinfo does have data for matches played before 1971, I stopped
at 1971 mainly for the reason that most pace bowlers with 100 or more
wickets - 75%, and 41 out of 46 bowlers with more than 200 wickets, made
their debut after 1971. Also, three people with more than 300 wickets
(whom I obviously wanted to include in the exercise) – Imran Khan (Pak),
DK Lillee (Aus) and RGD Willis (Eng), made their debut in 1971. Since
the exercise was to compare performance of frontline bowlers I excluded
anyone who did not tally 10 Overs (6 ball Overs) per match.</p>
<p>Using this data I fit a linear model to predict the number of Runs
conceded by a bowler using as predictors the number of balls bowled, the
opposition, the ground in which the match was played, the year in which
the match was played and home / away status. I let the effect of
home/away status to vary by Year in which the match was played and the
opposition as there have been some changes to the rules of cricket over
the years with regards to officiating and since the difference between
performances at home and away is varies (very high for some teams and
very low for other) by team. I also let the effect of opposition to vary
by Year to account for the fact that different teams have gone through
dominant, mediocre and weak phases between ’71 and ’14. The resulting
model had an R^2^ of 0.73 i.e., did pretty good in predicting the number
Runs a bowler conceded. To predict the number of wickets a bowler would
take in a match I fit a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_logit">proportional
odds</a> model using number of
balls bowled, opposition team, ground and home / away status as
predictors. The predicted values from these models gave me the expected
number of runs a bowler would concede and the expected number of wickets
a bowler would pick up in each match if he did as well as the average
bowler. So, to quantify how good each bowler did, I used the ratio of
Observed bowling average to Expected bowling average (Total  Expected
Runs / Total Expected Wickets). Bowlers with an O/E of 1 are just about
average while those with an O/E of less than 1 and greater than 1 are
better and worse respectively.</p>
<p>Let's try and visualize this. Below is a plot of the O/E Runs vs. O/E
Wickets. The green lines in the figure represent the 10^th^ and the
90^th^ percentile of the Oserved / Expected Average metric among 162
bowlers with at least 50 wickets in Test Cricket.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/50plusgoodbad.jpeg" /></p>
<p>While the likes of  Mcgrath, Ambrose, Clark did significantly better
than average with regards to wickets taken and runs conceded, the likes
of Bond, Waqar, Steyn struck at such a high rate that the extra runs
they leaked didn’t matter. Indeed Shane Bond had a career strike rate of
38.7 for his 87 wickets – the highest among pace bowlers with more than
50 Test wickets. Among the really bad bowlers who played a fair chunk of
test cricket were: Mohammad Sami – 85 wickets at O/E Avg = 1.45, Manoj
Prabhakar – 96 wickets at O/E Avg = 1.39, Lance Klusener – 80 wickets at
O/E Avg of 1.39, Ajit Agarkar – 56 wickets at O/E Avg of 1.35. It is
true that some of the really bad bowlers, like Klusener, McMillan,
Prabhakar could bat and did all right but the others seem to be just
disappointing stories. It is no surprise that none of their careers
lasted 50 Test Matches. Here's the complete list
- <a href="https://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/pace_bowlers_50_or_more_wkts.xlsx">Pace_bowlers_50_or_more_Wkts</a></p>
<p>But what I really wanted to see was how all the legends of pace bowling
did on this metric. So, here’s the same figure as above but with all
bowlers more than 248 wickets labelled. The dashed blue line represents
the median O/E Average and the blue lines above and below represents the
25^th^ and 75^th^ percentile respectively.</p>
<p><img alt="legendsofpace" src="http://saidee27.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/legendsofpace.jpeg" /></p>
<p>It seems that Bob Willis might have actually fared better than Lillee
through the length of their careers, that Zaheer and not Kapil was (is?)
India’s best seamer and that Gillespie’s role in the great Australian
side is kinda underappreciated – especially since Lee was somewhat
mediocre. By the O/E Average metric the 10 best bowlers with more than
248 wickets in Test Crikcet were:</p>

<p>I also looked at how bowlers performed at home and away. The really good
ones I expected to have done reasonably well everywhere. And that is
exactly what I found. I plotted the O/E Average at home against O/E
Average away for all bowlers with more than 50 test wickets at home and
away. The green and red lines in the figure represent the 25^th^ and
75^th^ percentile respectively. As you can see, the bowlers who were in
the top 25% at home and away were also in the top 10% (labelled in the
first figure) of bowlers with more than 50 wickets. In fact, other than
Wasim Akram, the bowlers who did good at home and away were the ‘Really
Good’ bowlers from earlier. You might want to check out some of the bad
ones (or maybe not).</p>

<p>It seems fairly clear that discussions of GOAT (Greatest of All Time)
should probably be restricted to Ambrose, Garner, Hadlee, Marshall,
Mcgrath, Steyn and Younis. To see how their performances over their
careers compared, I plotted (below) the cumulative O/E Average for the
top 6 (among those with more than 248 wickets) bowlers based on this
metric. It is no surprise Waqar had the most amazing first 30 games – at
his peak through 27 games Waqar had 154 wickets at an average of 18.35
and strike rate of 35.8. But Waqar’s career seems to have declined quite
a bit in his later years. In comparison McGrath and Marshall seem to
have hit another gear after their 80^th^ and 50^th^ test respectively.
Dale Steyn has been a little up and down but through 75 tests he is
right where Waqar, McGrath and Ambrose were but still quite far from
Marshall. It is difficult to say if he’ll hit another gear or decline
like Waqar and it probably will depend on how his body holds up. But it
is certain that he should be considered one of the five (or six)
greatest bowlers of all time. Here’s hoping that he finishes ahead
of the guy who picked up 563 wickets landing cutters in the corridor.</p>
